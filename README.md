# HackWasm Berlin - 2023/07/14-2023/07/16 - OKP4 Challenge

OKP4 testnet is ready for builders! Depending on your skills, imagine an application based on OKP4 Protocol contracts or tools to enhance its experience!

**More details coming soon, helpers and other materials will be continoulsy published! So don't hesitate to ‚≠ê this repo!**

## Challenge Description

OKP4 will enable a new generation of application to emerge, using a blockchain as an orchestration layer for shared off-chain resources, such as datasets, algorithms, software, and computation.

OKP4 has multiple layers:

1. The blockchain and smart contracts, where rules are defined and resources referenced
2. The dataverse, where off-chain resources are located
3. The application layer, where off-chain resources are used to create value.

Develop contracts leveraging the possibilities offered by the OKP4 architecture, or tools to interact with it.

## Requirements to win

To win the hackathon, your project must run/use on/the OKP4 testnet.

Although we are approaching the hackathon with a very open "use your creativity" un-restrictive track, we would love to see the following:

* Builders Program: Imagine original solutions from the [Builders Program](https://nemeton.okp4.network/builders/challenges#challenges) or use its resources for your project.
* Smart Contract Development: Tap into the potential of the Prolog Logic Module to create versatile, higher kinded Smart Contracts including the ability to generate Cosmos Msgs for execution.
* Interface Development: Unleash your imagination in designing interfaces that interact with OKP4 smart contracts (such as `objectarium`, `cognitarium`, `law-stone`). Yes, we are fond of text-based user interfaces (TUIs), but think beyond that and create something unique.
* VSCode Extension Development: Enrich the Developer Experience for Prolog development by coding a VSCode extension that interacts seamlessly with the Prolog Logic Module and OKP4 smart contracts (e.g. `law-stone`).
